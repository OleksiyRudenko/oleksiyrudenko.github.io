## Why?

At the moment this site holds Google domain verification.
Avoid cloning this repo and using `google*.html` as it may make
google believe your root github.io page belongs to me.

## I want the same

Navigate to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new).

Create a repository `username.github.io`. Initialize it with `README.md`.

Now you can add verification file from Google.

You can also tune-up
